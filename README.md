# go-newrelic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paultyng/go-newrelic.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paultyng/go-newrelic)

go-newrelic is a Go SDK for communicating with New Relic APIs.

## Installation

Use `go get` to install go-newrelic.

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/paultyng/go-newrelic
```

## Usage

```go
import "github.com/paultyng/go-newrelic/v4/api"	// with go modules enabled (GO111MODULE=on or outside GOPATH)
import "github.com/paultyng/go-newrelic/api" // with go modules disabled
```

Construct a new New Relic client, then use the various methods on the client to access different parts of the [New Relic V2 REST API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2). For example:

```go
config := newrelic.Config{
	APIKey: "<NEWRELIC_API_KEY>",
}

client := newrelic.New(config)
apps, err := client.ListApplications()
```

### Infrastructure Alert Conditions

Infrastructure Alert Conditions are backed by the [New Relic Infrastructure API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-alert-conditions/rest-api-calls-new-relic-infrastructure-alerts), and require the use of the `InfraClient` type:

```go
config := newrelic.Config{
	APIKey: "<NEWRELIC_API_KEY>",
}

client := newrelic.NewInfraClient(config)
apps, err := client.ListAlertInfraConditions(policyId)
```

The GoDoc link below details the available client options and the full list of available client methods.
